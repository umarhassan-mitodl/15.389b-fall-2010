The case write-up should be no more than three double-spaced pages (750 words). You may choose any case to analyze. Submit the write-up at the beginning of class on the day the case is to be discussed. This is an individual assignment, so please write up the case on your own, not with your project team. Case write-ups must be submitted for one of the following cases:

A write-up is an analytical discussion of issues central to the case. Please do not summarize the case or repeat case facts except to bolster your argument. Based on the information provided in the case materials, please be analytically critical and evaluative. You should propose alternate managerial views and action plans whenever appropriate and discuss the relevance and applicability of the frameworks proposed in the readings and lectures. In short, you should write what you think of the situation in the case and not merely what the author of the case says.

Note that some cases include study questions or write-up questions at the end of the text. These are study guidelines, not writing requirements. It is far more valuable to write a cogent analysis than to mechanically answer every question.
