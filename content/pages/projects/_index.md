Project Assignments
-------------------

You will form teams and jointly submit project applications after reviewing the available project opportunities, following the guidelines of the {{% resource_link 0a04dac8-348d-6047-0f2a-e9d8a5933ee6 "Teamwork and Match Process" %}}. All teams will be assigned a faculty mentor who will advise them throughout the development of their project.

Project Work Plan
-----------------

Although your team will have one or two faculty member(s) as your mentor(s) for all aspects of the project, it is your team's responsibility to negotiate and manage all aspects of the work plan and the project. After your team has been matched with a host company, you will make contact, begin building the relationship, and discuss the project. Based on those discussions, your team will create a detailed work plan outlining the project scope, detailed methodology, deliverables, milestones, and travel dates, as well as providing signature lines to obtain client's approval.

Your team will submit a draft work plan by Ses #12 for faculty review. Once you have your mentor(s)' feedback, you will incorporate it into a final work plan and obtain your host company's signoff by Ses #14. You will submit your host's signed copy of the work plan to your mentor(s).

Peer Review
-----------

You will complete a Peer Review worksheet for each member of your team twice in the semester. The Peer Review will give you the opportunity to provide qualitative and quantitative feedback on each individual's contribution to the team and working style. The first Peer Review will be done at the completion of your Research Report. At your next mentor meeting, your mentor(s) will lead you in a discussion about the reviews. At the conclusion of your internship, you will complete a second Peer Review and submit the information to your faculty mentor(s).

Remote (MIT-based) Internship and Remote Research Report (RRR)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Your team will undertake a great deal of preliminary research and analysis on your project during the fall. This research is to be encapsulated in the RRR, a substantial, stand-alone deliverable to your host. RRRs are often industry analyses, market research findings, technology studies, or similar reports that give clients new insights and guidance. They are not data-dumps of everything you ever read. Although you should negotiate the scope of your RRR with your client and mentor(s), you should expect to produce at least 20 double-spaced pages of text (approximately 5000 words, not including tables and appendices) of analysis, synthesis, and interim conclusions. A great RRR is a critical step in making your on-site internship and client relationship successful.

The RRR includes an Executive Summary, proper citations throughout, and a bibliography. The Executive Summary should be 3-4 sentences, no more than 100 words, describing the host company and the project as you would explain it to an outsider â€“ such as a journalist.

Your team will submit a draft RRR on Ses #19 for faculty review. Once you have your mentors' feedback, you will incorporate it into a final RRR and submit it to your host company and mentor(s) by Ses #22.

On-site Internship, Poster, Company Deliverables, and Final Internship Report
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The internship goal is for your team to work professionally on-site with senior management and staff as effective consultants. Your team must be all together, on-site, for a minimum of three consecutive work weeks (Monday-Friday). As in any professional endeavor, you are to deliver analysis, advice and recommendations that add value, are appropriate, and will be immediately useful to your company. During and after the on-site internship, you will have the following deliverables:

*   You will make a formal presentation to your company on the first day of your onsite internship summarizing your RRR. You will deliver a copy of this presentation as part of your company deliverables to your team advisor upon your return to MIT.
  
*   You will make a formal presentation to your company at the end of your onsite internship and provide them with supporting written analysis and data according to your agreement with your client. You will deliver a copy (or summary) of your company deliverables to your team advisor upon your return to MIT.
  
*   _Debrief & Reflection Session_: After your internship, you will attend a required session. This will be the final classroom commitment of G-Lab, and an opportunity to reflect on everything you've learned. You must be back on campus for this session.
  
*   _Poster_: We will hold G-Lab Day a week after your return. This major G-Lab event draws a large and enthusiastic audience from the entire MIT community. To highlight and publicize your work, your team must prepare a poster and staff a presentation position during this event. It will be widely advertised and you should expect considerable interest, scrutiny, and questions.
  
*   _Final Internship Report_: Due after G-Lab Day. The final written report should demonstrate your understanding of the company, its comparative strengths and weaknesses, and your project focus. In addition, you should  
    1.  Provide an Executive Summary about your project, similar to the one produced for the RRR but covering the total scope, results, and learnings from the project.
    2.  Answer all of the following questions (in any order):
        *   How did this internship meet the four goals of G-Lab, as outlined at the beginning of this syllabus?
        *   How exactly did your team add value?
        *   What was your team's greatest learning from this internship?
        *   What specific issues does the company face because of where it is located?
    3.  You should also provide reasonable forecasts for the future of the company, given your projections of the relevant macroeconomic and microeconomic environment.

The final report should be a minimum of 15 double-spaced pages of text (approximately 3750 words), plus any tables and appendices that help the reader.

Note: In past years, outstanding teams have prepared their final report in a form that can be used effectively as a teaching case in MBA classes. We encourage this approach but do not require it. If your team would like to write its report as a case, please speak to your faculty mentor(s) for approval.

*   _Resource Report_: A required appendix to your final report. The Resource Report is your team's compilation of all relevant resources on which you relied to get your project done efficiently. This will include not just bibliographical and standard research and trade industry data, but practical, networking and/or entrepreneurial resources you drew on. We will discuss the Resource Report and its content in class.

After Action Review
-------------------

At the conclusion of your on-site internship, we ask you to write an "After Action" review of what you learned. This will be the time to reflect on your experience of the team, the client and company, and living and working in another country. The essay should be approximately three double-spaced pages (750 words).

Your essay should include a reflection on the class sessions, mentoring sessions, experience working with your client and your team. This is not a summary of what you did but rather a reflection on what you learned from these experiences. You might consider discussing what you will take away from the class as a whole: how your experience will affect your conduct in a future team, what you did well and what you would do differently in working with a client, how have you added to your network of contacts?
